# instead of `shards install && shards build`: shard.yml only declares the
# ameba dev dependency, and installing it would make every image build
# depend on cloning ameba@master from GitHub for nothing. (`--production`
# is not an option because shard.lock is gitignored.)

# HTTPS targets need plus a busybox shell for scripting around results in
# CI. Version/revision labels are injected at build time by
